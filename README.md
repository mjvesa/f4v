Herd
====
Herd is a concatenative programming language derived
from Forth. Herd is intended to be quite compatible with Forth, although
it does not strive to be 100% compatible. It has bindings to the Vaadin UI toolkit
and also a small persistence API based on plain SQL used trough JDBC.


Installing
==========
Herd development is done with the help of maven. This makes running Herd rather easy. Naturally, the repo must be cloned
first. Cloning the master branch is recommended at the moment, as the version branches are simply snapshots
of different development phases and there are no guarantees of stability in any case. So go with master, as it
has all the latest changes.

One thing needs to be changed in the sources before installing. That is the directory that holds all the Herd source
files. This is the Herd-directory at the root of the cloned repository. Change the constant string FILE_DIRECTORY
in Files.java to point to the directory you intend to keep your Herd sources in. This arrangement is only temporary, and
should change once issue #15 has been resolved.

To build Herd and to fetch all its dependencies, type this into a console:

	mvn install

After that is done, running Herd in a jetty instance can be done as follows:

	mvn jetty:run

Herd can now be accessed by directing your favorite browser at `http://localhost:8080/Herd`


Quick UI walktrough
===================
The UI is not very complex, mostly since it is quite unfinished. In the Files tab we can open a source file by
clicking its name in the file list. The file can be saved by clicking the Save button. Change the name next to the Save
button to save under a different name. Press the execute button to run the currently open file, and inspect the results
by clicking on the Output tab next to the Editor tab. When "Clear and execute" is used to execute the program instead
then the previous output is first removed. The same effect can be achieved by clicking "Clear layout" in the Output tab.

The console under the editor panel contains useful messages about program execution. It is filled bottom-to-top, so that
the latest message is at the top. "Clear console" clears the console of previous output.

The checkbox "log executed words" prints every executed word on the console. "log added words" prints every new word
created by a colon definition.

The Status tab shows a list of all defined words. When the "print stack" button above it is pressed, the contents of the
data stack are printed onto the console.

Notice that the vertical bar between the two rows of tabs, and the horizontal bar between the editor and the console
can be dragged to resize things. This can be used to see more of what is happening in the console, and so on.
